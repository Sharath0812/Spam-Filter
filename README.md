Spam-Filter
What I have here is a simple spam filter that has been trained on a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged according being ham (legitimate) or spam.

Content
The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.

Acknowledgements
The original dataset can be found here. The creators would like to note that in case you find the dataset useful, please make a reference to previous paper and the web page: http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/ in your papers, research, etc.

Inspiration
Can you use this dataset to build a prediction model that will accurately classify which texts are spam?
